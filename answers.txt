1. If you negate the weights of each edge in the frontier and run the algorithm, it will give you a maximum spanning tree. (Source: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MaximumSpanningTree.html)

2. Minimum-spanning-tree does not take into account direction like the Traveling Salesman problem requires. In both, the minimum distance is required, but the Traveling Salesman problem also requires returning to the starting point.

4. Jarnik's algorithm has a time complexity of O((|V| + |E|) log|V|) with a priority queue and O(|V^2|) without a priority queue. The extra time without a priority queue requires linearly searching through the list to find the minimum weighted edge each time. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm#Time_complexity)

5. Jarnik's algorithm is a greedy algorithm because it chooses the locally optimal choice at each step - it runs for immediate benefit at each step (and working with MST's) to produce the optimal solution for the whole problem.

6. Gaussian elimination, or Gauss-Jordan elimination, was credited to Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), but was originally documented by Chinese mathematicians in around 179 AD. The purpose of the algorithm is to use elementary row operations to transform a matrix into upper triangular form (or reduced row echelon form). The original "creators" did not get credit likely because of linguistic and geographic barriers, as many mathematical concepts emerged independently from the west that are equivalent to Western mathematics.
